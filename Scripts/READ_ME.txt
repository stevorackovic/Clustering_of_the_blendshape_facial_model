The scripts for applying the proposed algorithm.
Clustering.py - functions that segment a character's face
GPR.py        - performs regression over a clustered face in order to solve the inverse rig problem.
Python_evaluation.py - Evaluates the results of the regeression
Maya_evaluation.py - Takes the controllers' predictions from GPR and plugs it in the software (Maya Autodesk) to get the meshes.
