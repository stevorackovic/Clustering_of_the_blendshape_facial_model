The scripts for applying the proposed algorithm:
Clustering.py - functions that segment a character's face,
GPR.py        - performs regression over the clustered face to solve the inverse rig problem,
Python_evaluation.py - evaluates the results of the regression,
Maya_evaluation.py - takes the controllers' predictions from GPR and plugs them in the software (Maya Autodesk) to get the meshes.
