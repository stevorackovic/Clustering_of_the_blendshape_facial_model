# Clustering_of_the_blendshape_facial_model

This reporsitory contains scripts used for the paper 'Clustering of the Blendshape Facial Model' that is available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616061&casa_token=HYjbGkT3rN4AAAAA:gcYlhRHvQXrFvyPdIhETSsldBY7Tuwhkiq54KtA5-4wAb3hLXvMuJBESXcNcnbSw3_4pXLm8pE0&tag=1. 
For a quick recap on the method you cacn check https://stevorackovic.github.io/clustering.html

The data used in this paper is proprietary, hence we could not provide it. However, you can find a number of high-quality face blendshape models within metahumans platform (https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator-apply?sessionInvalidated=true) that are ready to use. The head models don't come with animation, but we provide some test data for three characters: Omar, Danielle and Myles, together with the script for extracting the blendshape matrix from Maya. The script is in the folder named Metahumans, together with the files containing names of the blendshape controllers and the corresponding activation weights for each.
